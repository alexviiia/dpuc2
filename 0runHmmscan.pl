Usage: perl -w $0 <hmmscan> <Pfam-A.hmm> <FASTA input> <output table>

The required inputs are
    <hmmscan>      the path to the HMMER3 hmmscan executable.
    <Pfam-A.hmm>   the path to your HMM library of choice (in HMMER3 format).
    <FASTA input>  the FASTA sequence file, may be compressed with gzip.
    <output table> the hmmscan output is plain text table delimited by whitespace (always
                   uncompressed).

See the online manual for more info.
