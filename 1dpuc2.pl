Usage: perl -w $0 <Pfam-A.hmm.dat> <dpucNet> <input table> <output table>

The required inputs are
    <Pfam-A.hmm.dat>  Pfam annotation file, contains GA thresholds and nesting network.
    <dpucNet>         Directed context network of domain family pair counts.
    <input table>     The output from hmmscan (previous script).
    <output table>    Input with most domains removed by dPUC. Format is identical to input.

It is your responsability to ensure that the same Pfam version is used for Pfam-A.hmm.dat, 
the dPUC context network, and the input table.

Input file may be compressed with gzip, and may be specified with or without the .gz 
extension.  Output file will be automatically compressed with gzip.

See the online manual for more info.
